<p>
The <a href="http://www.lifl.fr/SMAC/projects/ioda/ioda_for_netlogo/">IODA extension</a> comes with a <code>tutorial</code> directory, which contains
a large number of code examples. Especially, the <code>0-template</code>
directory provides 3 files that can be used for starting your own model:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>model.nlogo</code> : a NetLogo file (see below)
</li>
<li><code>interactions.txt</code> : a text file which describes all available interactions
</li>
<li><code>matrix.txt</code> : a text file in CSV format which describes what
interactions are assigned to source and target agent families,
with the corresponding priority, limit distance and target
selection policy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>For this tutorial we have packed a <a href="template.zip">template.zip</a> file which you just need to download and unpack.</b>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Include and extension</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The IODA NetLogo extension is composed of 2 parts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the <code>ioda</code> directory, containing the file <code>ioda.jar</code>, can be
either installed within the <code>extensions</code> directory of your
NetLogo installation directory, or at the same level of the
models that you develop
</li>
<li>the file <code>IODA_2_2.nls</code>, which is a source file written in
NetLogo, can be put anywhere but you have to specify the full
path of the file to access it; a quite simple solution is to put
a copy of this file in the directory where you have your own
models.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus the template model begins with the following lines:
</p>
<pre class="example">
__includes ["IODA_2_2.nls"]  ; here the path of the nls file
extensions [ioda]
</pre>
<p>
which ensure that both the include source code and the Java extension are loaded.
</p>

<p>
The template model contains the two main procedures required to
initialize and run any model: <code>setup</code> and <code>go</code> (attached to the
corresponding buttons in the NetLogo graphical interface). 
</p>
<pre class="example">
to setup
  clear-all
  ioda:load-interactions "interactions.txt"
  ioda:load-matrices "matrix.txt" " \t"
  ioda:setup
  reset-ticks
end

to go
  ioda:go
  tick
end
</pre>
<p>
The <code>setup</code> procedure is in charge of loading the definition of
interactions in the specified text file, then loading the assignation
of interactions to specific agents through an interaction and an
update matrix, then the IODA engine initializes the model. You may use
your own filenames (provided that you change them in the <code>setup</code>
procedure).
</p>

<p>
The <code>go</code> procedure delegates the scheduling of the IODA agents to a
dedicated procedure, <code>ioda:go</code>, which is defined in the include file.
</p>

<p>
In the next steps, you should have very few things to add inside those
procedures.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
If everything is installed properly, the interface view should look as shown below.
If any error occurs when clicking on the <code>setup</code> button or on the <code>go</code> button,
you should check again the installation procedure.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> First Steps: A Simple Predator-Prey Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Now we are going to implement a naive predator-prey model with the
classical sheep and wolves. We shall start with the following
specifications:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sheep and wolves wander (walk randomly) through the environment
</li>
<li>when two sheep meet, they can produce offspring (a delay must be
introduced to prevent them to produce offspring at each tick)
</li>
<li>a wolf can eat a sheep
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> The corresponding interaction matrix</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
This situation can be summarized in the form of an <b>interaction
matrix</b> according to the IODA approach, like the matrix below.  Except
for the 1st column (source agents) and the 1st line (target agents),
each cell contains the interactions that the source agent (agent at
the left of the line) can perform on the target agent (agent at the
top of the column). The column marked with &empty; represents
interactions where the target agent is the source agent itself, which
are called <b>reflexive interactions</b>.

<p>
This description is to be read as follows: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <b>sheep</b> can perform the <code>Wander</code> interaction alone (i.e. with no
other target), with priority 0
</li>
<li>same thing for a <b>wolf</b>
</li>
<li>a <b>sheep</b> can perform the <code>Mate</code> interaction with <b>another sheep</b>,
with priority level 10, at distance &le; 0.5
</li>
<li>a <b>wolf</b> can perform the <code>Eat</code> interaction with a <b>sheep</b>, with
priority level 10, at distance &le; 1.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
N.B.: When an agent tries to perform interactions, it select one among the
realizable interactions with the highest priority level. Thus only the
order relation among interactions on the same line is relevant. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the IODA extension, this interaction matrix is encoded as a CSV
file where each line represents the affectation of an interaction to a
source family, with a priority level, and possibly a target family and
the corresponding limit distance. 
</p>

<p>
Thus you have to add those informations to the file <code>matrix.txt</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
; This file can be used to define your own interaction
; matrix and update matrix.
; SYNTAX:
; &lt;source&gt; &lt;interaction&gt; &lt;priority&gt;
; OR: &lt;source&gt; &lt;interaction&gt; &lt;priority&gt; UPDATE
; OR: &lt;source&gt; &lt;interaction&gt; &lt;priority&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;distance&gt; [&lt;target-selection-policy&gt;]
;
; NB1: this file is read as a CSV file, thus you can use any field separator char 
; since you put it in the second argument of the ioda:load-matrices command.
;
; NB2: any non-letter, non-digit character at the beginning
; of the line introduces a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> The definition of interactions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The interactions we have here are quite simple:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Wander</code> consists of a single action: the random walk
</li>
<li><code>Mate</code>: if both source and target are able
to mate, they must produce a new agent and remember the current tick
</li>
<li><code>Eat</code>: if the source is hungry, if digests the target and destroys it
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus those interactions can be expressed in the IODA formalism as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
; This file can be used to define your own interactions.
; SYNTAX:
; [EXCLUSIVE|PARALLEL] INTERACTION &lt;name&gt;
; [TRIGGER &lt;tr1&gt; ... &lt;tr_n&gt;]
; [...]
; [TRIGGER &lt;tr'1&gt; ... &lt;tr'_n&gt;]
; [CONDITION &lt;cond1&gt; ... &lt;cond_n&gt;]
; [...]
; [CONDITION &lt;cond'1&gt; ... &lt;cond'_n&gt;]
; [ACTIONS &lt;act1&gt; ... &lt;act_n&gt;]
; END
;
; NB1: tr_i and cond_i are abstract condition primitives,
; which must be implemented by concrete reporters, while
; act_i are abstract action primitives, which must be
; implemented by concrete commands.
;
; NB2: any non-letter, non-digit character at the beginning
; of the line introduces a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.
;

INTERACTION	Wander
  ACTIONS	choose-direction advance
END

INTERACTION	Mate
  CONDITION	after-delay? target:after-delay?
  ACTIONS	reset-timer target:reset-timer produce-offspring
END

INTERACTION	Eat
  TRIGGER	hungry?
  ACTIONS	digest target:die
END
</pre>

<p>
Two important things to notice:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Interactions use abstract condition and action primitives. By
default, they are evaluated by the source agent (the agent that
tries to perform the interaction). The special keyword <code>target:</code>
means that the primitive is evaluated by the target agent (the
partner of the interaction, the agent that undergoes the
interaction).
</li>
<li><b>The <code>TRIGGER</code> clause</b> instead of the <code>CONDITION</code> in interaction
<code>Eat</code>.  From an operational point of view it does not make any
difference. Yet, the <code>TRIGGER</code> is aimed at expressing a <b>goal</b>
(i.e. the reason why this interaction should be performed), while
the <code>CONDITION</code> represents a prerequisite for executing the
actions.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">

<h4 id="sec-2-3-1">Breed declaration and initialization</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
The first thing to do is to declare the two turtle breeds we are going
to use, with their properties (for now, the <code>sheep</code> just need a timer
to know whether they can mate or not).
</p>

<pre class="example">
breed [sheep]
breed [wolves wolf]

sheep-own [ last-offspring ]
</pre>

<p>
Then we have to write a procedure for initializing random populations.
Below is an example for that. Do not forget to add the corresponding
sliders in the user interface: respectively, <b><code>nb-sheep</code></b> and <b><code>nb-wolves</code></b>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
to setup
  clear-all
  ioda:load-interactions "interactions.txt"
  ioda:load-matrices "matrix.txt" " \t"
  init-world
  ioda:setup
  reset-ticks
end

to init-world
  ask patches [set pcolor green]
  set-default-shape sheep "sheep"
  set-default-shape wolves "wolf"
  create-sheep nb-sheep [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor set color white]
  create-wolves nb-wolves [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor set color gray]
end
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
At this step if you click on the <code>setup</code> button, then on the <code>go</code>
button, you get an error message. Indeed, the IODA engine detects
agent families (NetLogo breeds) that, according to the interaction
matrix, can perform interactions which make use of (yet) undefined
primitives.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now click on the <b><code>show primitives to write</code></b> button. In the output area, you get the following text:
</p>
<pre class="example">
to-report sheep::after-delay?
end

to-report wolves::hungry?
end

to sheep::filter-neighbors
end

to wolves::filter-neighbors
end

to sheep::reset-timer
end

to sheep::produce-offspring
end

to sheep::choose-direction
end

to sheep::advance
end

to wolves::digest
end

to sheep::die
end

to wolves::choose-direction
end

to wolves::advance
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the list of all pieces of NetLogo code that you have to write
so as to define the actual (operational) meaning of the primitives.
Perception primitives are NetLogo <i>reporters</i> (<code>to-report ... report ... end</code>)
while action primitives are NetLogo <i>procedures</i> (<code>to ... end</code>). The name of a
concrete primitive is composed of the name of the breed (e.g. <code>sheep</code>
or <code>wolves</code>) and the name of the abstract primitive (as it appears in
the definition of the interaction), separated by <code>::</code>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A special primitive is required for agents that are able to act as
sources on other agents (i.e. for <i>active</i> agent families): the
<b><code>filter-neighbors</code></b> primitive. It defines <b>the perception
capabilities</b> of the agent. If left empty, the agent is able to
perceive all agents on which it can perform interactions (e.g. sheep
would perceive all other sheep, wolves would perceive only
sheep). Usually agents have a limited perception range, thus the
actual neighbors, i.e. the agents that are likely to undergo
interactions, result from a selection among the default list of
potential targets. A simple way to do this is to use predefined IODA
filtering procedures, e.g. for filtering within a given radius:
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
; sheep can see other agents in a circle of radius 1
to sheep::filter-neighbors
  ioda:filter-neighbors-in-radius 1
end

; wolves have a larger perception halo
to wolves::filter-neighbors
  ioda:filter-neighbors-in-radius 2
end
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another important thing is the way to "remove" agents from a IODA
simulation. Since we use a special scheduling algorithm, you <b>must
not</b> use the NetLogo <code>die</code> primitive: you have to use <b><code>ioda:die</code></b>
instead. 
</li>
<li>For the same reasons, when creating a new agent, you have to notify
the IODA simulation engine. This is done by calling
<b><code>ioda:init-agent</code></b>.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Now, try to write the corresponding code and test it (<code>setup</code> then
<code>go</code>).
</p>

<p>
<a href="text/code1.nls">Here</a> is a possible solution (typical values for parameters:
<code>nb-sheep</code>: 300, <code>nb-wolves</code>: 10, <code>sheep-offspring-delay</code>: 20).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
First, we want to add a new species in the simulation. This is quite
simple, since the interactions are the <b>abstract description</b> of a
behavior. Thus, they are designed to be re-used among different kinds of agents.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we want to add <b>rabbits</b> in the ecosystem. At this step,
rabbits behave like sheep (they mate and walk around), and we suppose
that wolves prefer eating rabbits than sheep (easier to kill ?). Also,
we suppose that rabbits move a bit faster than sheep and do not have
the same delay between offspring.

<p>
N.B.: The priority for the <code>Eat</code> interaction on the "wolves" row is
higher for rabbits than for sheep: thus, during the interaction
selection process, a wolf agent tries first to perform this
interaction on a rabbit agent, if any is present and fulfils the
conditions. If not possible, it tries then to perform it on a sheep
agent.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add the convenient lines in the text file describing the interaction matrix.
</li>
<li>Add the new breed in the NetLogo model and initialise the population in the <code>setup</code> procedure.

sheep and rabbits (regarding how behaviors are actually carried
out) are to be encoded in the primitives.

step, you should also add a plot to follow the evolution of agents
population.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Aging: UPDATE processes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
We now want to extend the current simulation model by taking into
account the following processes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>wolves</b> have a limited lifetime and can die from old age
</li>
<li>they also can die of starvation (e.g. when they have no food reserve)
</li>
<li>to counterbalance the subsequent decrease of wolves population, we
now want wolves to mate as sheep and rabbits do.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Obviously the aging process takes place at each tick, independently
from interaction selection. The fact that the age increases must not
prevent a wolf from eating a sheep, and vice-versa. <i>Aging</i> is a
spontaneous state change which occurs in the agent, while <i>Eating</i>
is a "deliberate" behavior (chosen among others, such as
<i>Wandering</i>).
</p>

<p>
In IODA such processes are represented through an <b>update matrix</b>.
At each tick, all interactions realizable in the update matrix are
performed, then only the interaction selection step begins.
</p>

<p>
The new update and interaction matrices can be rewritten as follows:

<p>
The interaction matrix now integrates the capability of wolves to Mate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This leads to the new <code>matrix.txt</code> file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
; interaction matrix
sheep	Wander	0
sheep	Mate	10	sheep	0.5
wolves	Wander	0
wolves	Eat	10	sheep	1
wolves	Eat	20	rabbits	1
wolves	Mate	30	wolves	1
rabbits	Wander	0
rabbits	Mate	10	rabbits	0.5

; update matrix
wolves	 Age	10	UPDATE
wolves	 Metabolism	10	UPDATE
wolves	 Die	0	UPDATE
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now the new interactions have to be added in the <code>interactions.txt</code> file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
INTERACTION	Age
  ACTIONS	increase-age
END

INTERACTION Metabolism
  ACTIONS   decrease-reserve
END

INTERACTION	Die
  TRIGGER	old-age?
  TRIGGER	starving?
  ACTIONS	die
END
</pre>

<p>
An important thing to notice in the <code>Die</code> interaction: the <b>two</b>
<code>TRIGGER</code> lines. This is the way to express a <b>disjunction (logical
OR)</b>. In that case, the <code>Die</code> interaction is realizable either if
the source agent is old, or if it has no more food reserve. At
least one must be true to allow the interaction to occur.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
You also have several additional primitives to write, which themselves
imply to endow the wolves with new attributes (e.g. <code>last-offspring</code>,
<code>food-reserve</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>lifespan</code>):
</p>
<pre class="example">
to-report wolves::after-delay?
end

to-report wolves::old-age?
end

to-report wolves::starving?
end

to wolves::reset-timer
end

to wolves::produce-offspring
end

to wolves::increase-age
end

to wolves::decrease-reserve
end

to wolves::die
end
</pre>

<p>
It is also a good idea to write a procedure <code>wolves::init</code> so as to
initialize those new attributes and run <code>ioda:init-agent</code> each time a
new wolf is created.
</p>

<p>
A possible solution is proposed <a href="text/code3.nls">here</a> (typical values for parameters:
<code>nb-sheep</code>: 200, <code>nb-wolves</code>: 15, <code>nb-rabbits</code>: 200,
<code>sheep-offspring-delay</code>: 20, <code>rabbits-offspring-delay</code>: 10,
<code>wolves-offspring-delay</code>: 15, <code>avg-wolves-lifespan</code>: 80,
<code>wolves-metabolism</code>: 0.2).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Now we are going to refine the model so as to allow wolves to track
sheep, and conversely to make sheep gather and flee the wolves. In
addition, rabbits just try to flee the wolves.

<p>
As you can see in this matrix, we need only two new interactions
(<code>MoveTowards</code> and <code>MoveAway</code>) to introduce the new behaviors.
</p>

</blockquote>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write the corresponding <code>matrix.txt</code> text file
</li>
<li>Write the <code>MoveTowards</code> and <code>MoveAway</code> interactions. Therefore you
need to use a property called <code>ioda:my-target</code>, which refers to the
agent which is interacting with the caller.
</li>
<li>Test your behaviors
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="text/code4.nls">Here</a> is a possible implementation.
</p>

<p>
You should note that the "hunt" behavior of the wolves is not very
efficient, since they choose the target randomly (even if another one
is closer). IODA allows the specification of a <b>target selection
policy</b> in the matrix file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wolves  MoveTowards 5 sheep 2 BEST:proximity
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Going further</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Now you should be able to extend this model in many directions. Here
are a few ideas to experiment.  If you need to use more advanced
features of the IODA extension, you may look at the Tutorial provided
in the extension package or available on-line <a href="http://www.lifl.fr/SMAC/projects/ioda/ioda_for_netlogo/doc/IODA-NetLogo-Tutorial.html">here</a>, or ask me
directly!
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In order to limit the population of rabbits, endow them with an aging process.
</li>
<li><i>Human Hunters</i> arrive in the ecosystem: they hunt sheep too. But, indeed,
they do not eat all the food but are able to share it.
</li>
<li>Human hunters are able to put a few collets in the environment to
trap rabbits. They must memorize their position and inspect them
from time to time.  Of course, according to the IODA point of view,
<b>collets</b> are agents too!
</li>
<li>Human hunters can be attacked by wolves when these are really
hungry, but conversely they can kill wolves when they have few food
reserves.
</li>
<li>Sometimes human hunters suceed in turning young wolves into hounds
which help them to hunt. Hunters share the food with hounds, but
conversely when hounds are starving they may come back to wild
life.
</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use e.g. a <i>forum</i> to centralize or
coordinate the activity of the hunters, share information or food,
and so on&#x2026; Therefore, a good way to proceed is to consider the
forum as an agent having a network-based perception of its
neighbors (e.g. the human hunters that are related to it). To do
so, you can create links between several hunters and a forum, and
use the pre-defined primitive <b><code>ioda:filter-neighbors-on-mylinks</code></b>
in the <code>forum::filter-neighbors</code> primitive.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thank you for attending this tutorial. We hope you are now convinced
by the advantage of separating agents from generic behaviors expressed
as interaction rules. Do not hesitate to use the IODA extension for
NetLogo for your own research or teaching, or to contact us (<code>ioda</code>
<i>at</i> <code>univ-lille1.fr</code>) if you need more information or if you plan to
build large-scale simulations (e.g. using our Java platform, <a href="http://www.lifl.fr/SMAC/projects/ioda/jedi/presentation.php">JEDI</a>).
