; SYNTAX:
; [EXCLUSIVE|PARALLEL] INTERACTION <name>
; [TRIGGER <tr1> ... <tr_n>]

; NB1: tr_i and cond_i are abstract condition primitives,
; which must be implemented by concrete reporters, while
; act_i are abstract action primitives, which must be
; implemented by concrete commands.
;
; NB2: any non-letter, non-digit character at the beginning
; of the line introduces a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.
